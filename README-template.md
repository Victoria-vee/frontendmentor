## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Borders
- CSS Margins
- CSS Padding
- Desktop-first workflow



### What I learned
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  body{
      background-color: hsl(198, 100%, 95%);
      padding: 100px;
      }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on css padding, margins, borders. It was what kept me in this project for a while

### Useful resources

- [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - I used it to learn more about paddings and margins. It helped
know which one to apply
- [Chat GPT](https://chatgpt.com) - I asked Chat GPT how to center the texts and QR code in the container
